# bootcamp-project-1

We are the Acme Corp Data Analyst Team and have been hired by Coyote inc to help them find a location
for their newest factory.  We have been tasked with finding a location with the cheapest labor with the
best productivity output. We're analysing the Labor and Productivity data from the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics. We will determine the top 3 states in the US which meet Coyote Inc's labor and 
productivity requirements. Then we will provide additional data on those states according to Coyote 
Inc's othere needs.
