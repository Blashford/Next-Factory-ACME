Acme Corp Data Analyst Team
- Blake Ashford, Courtney Robison, Ryan Simpson, Lucienne Kaplan, Savannah Cordry

We are the Acme Corp Data Analyst Team and have been hired by Coyote Inc to help them find a location
for their newest factory.  We have been tasked with finding a location with the cheapest labor with the
best productivity output. We're analysing the Labor and Productivity data from the U.S. Bureau of 
Labor Statistics looking at the last five years of data (2014-2019). 

We will determine the top 3 states in the US which meet Coyote Inc's labor and productivity requirements. Then we will provide additional data on those states according to Coyote Inc's other criteria.
